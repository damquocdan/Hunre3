## Configuration and Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone or Download the Repository:**

- Fork and clone the repository using Git, or download it as a ZIP file and unzip it on your local machine.

2. **Install XAMPP:**

- XAMPP is required for hosting a local server and MySQL database. If you haven't installed it, follow these steps:
  - Download XAMPP from the official website: [XAMPP Download](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).
  - Install XAMPP by running the downloaded installer.
  - Launch the XAMPP control panel and start the Apache and MySQL services.

3. **Database Setup:**

- Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin/` to access the phpMyAdmin dashboard.
- Create a new database for your project (e.g., "shoelike_db").
- Import Data:
  - In your project's directory, you'll find a `data.sql` file. This file contains the database structure and initial data.
  - In phpMyAdmin, select your newly created database and click on the "Import" tab.
  - Choose the data.sql file and click "Go" to import the data into the database.

4. **Project Configuration:**

- Open the project in your preferred code editor.
- Locate any configuration files (like `.env` or `config.php`) that might store database connection settings (in this project it is `pdo.php` in the models folder).
- Update the database connection settings (such as host, username, password, and database name) to match your XAMPP configuration.

5. **Running the Project:**

- With XAMPP's Apache and MySQL services running, open your web browser.
- Type `http://localhost/` followed by the path to your project's main file (e.g., `http://localhost/shoelike/`).
- You should now see your SHOELIKE project running locally.

6. **Testing:**

- Test the various features of the website to ensure everything is working as expected.
